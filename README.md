# C++ and Unreal Engine Projects
This repository demonstrates basic examples of C++ fundamentals and exercises, including basic syntax and operations, sorting, and the use of third-party libraries for further functionalities. Some of the more interesting projects include:
- [Airport Database](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/CPlusPlus-and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/tree/main/AirportDatabase) : Console application for searching airports by name or ID. 
- [Calculator Tutorial](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/CPlusPlus-and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/tree/main/CalculatorTutorial) : An exercise creating a basic and functional calculator
- [Guess My Number](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/CPlusPlus-and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/tree/main/GuessMyNumber) : A basic approach to random number generation
- [LetterRace](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/CPlusPlus-and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/tree/main/LetterRace) : A simple console application that works with random movement of a character (a-z) across the screen in a 'race' to the finish 
- [Sudoku](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/CPlusPlus-and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/tree/main/Sudoku) : A brief example of creating an algorithm that solves a grid with minimal, pre-determined values
